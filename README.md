# detectDesign

Tools for targeted binding (e.g. for gene regulation, DNA detection,..)
- find genetic targets that can be targeted specifically
- design guide RNAs to target sequences
- design pairs of guide RNA to target sequences (e.g. for DNA detection)
- report nearest off-targets, and score for specificity
